This repository contains my Python coursework and practice assignments.  
I’m using this repo to:  

1. **Learn and practice Git/GitHub** for version control and collaboration.  
2. **Document my progress in Python** as I work through assignments, exercises, and projects.  
3. **Showcase my commitment to learning** and building a strong foundation in programming.

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- Each assignment is stored in its own file or folder.  
- File names generally match the assignment number or topic (e.g., `assignment1.py`, `loops_exercise.py`).  
- Additional notes or explanations may be included in comments within the code.  

---

## 🛠️ Skills & Topics Covered  
These assignments cover a variety of Python fundamentals, such as:  

- Variables, data types, and operators  
- Control flow (`if`, `for`, `while`)  
- Functions and scope  
- Error handling and exceptions  
- File input/output  
- Data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)  
- Object-oriented programming basics  
- Problem solving and algorithm design  

---

## 🚀 Goals  
- Strengthen my Python programming skills through hands-on practice.  
- Develop good coding habits (readable code, comments, and structure).  
- Gain familiarity with Git/GitHub workflows (commits, branches, pull requests).

## 🔍 Notes for Employers / Reviewers  
This repo is not meant to be a polished product, but rather a **record of my learning process**.  
Each file represents a step in my journey toward becoming a stronger programmer.  
As I continue, I’ll add more assignments and possibly small projects that demonstrate growth over time.

## 🎥 Screenshots / Demos  
Here I’ll add visuals for selected assignments or projects:
